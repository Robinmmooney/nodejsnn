1: fundementals of node js:

node.js is a Javascript runtime built on the Google chromes V8 Javascript engine
it uses event driven, non blocking model that makes it lightweight and efficient.  
node.js package ecosystem, (NPM), is the largest ecosystem of open source 
libraries in the world.

Node.js is javascript running on the backend of the server, allows you to delete, read and
update files.

Easily commincates with a database.

very fast(runs on the v8 engine) & uses non blocking code.

Great for realtime services, like chat and social media.

2: Project Readme:

Node.js Oberview:

    -V8 engine - 
    
    -Modules - In the Node.js module system, each file is treated as a separate module. For example, 
    consider a file named foo.js:

const circle = require('./circle.js');
console.log(`The area of a circle of radius 4 is ${circle.area(4)}`);
On the first line, foo.js loads the module circle.js that is in the same directory as foo.js.
    
    -Event Emitter - Much of the Node.js core API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous event-driven 
    architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called "emitters") emit named events that cause 
    Function objects ("listeners") to be called
    
    -The file system - The fs module provides an API for interacting with the file system in a manner closely modeled around standard POSIX functions.

To use this module:

const fs = require('fs');

    -Express- 
    
    -   Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js
    
    -   It is designed for building web applications and APIs.[3] It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
    
    -   Express is the E in the MEAN stack. (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node) or MERN (Mongo Express React and Node).
    
    - Express.js was founded by TJ Holowaychuk - 22nd of May, 2010. Version 0.12.0.
